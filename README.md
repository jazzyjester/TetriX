# 🧩 TetriX - A Classic Tetris Game Built in Delphi 7

Welcome to **TetriX**—a classic Tetris game that I created in Delphi 7! This project was a personal goal of mine, inspired by a lesson from a programming lecturer who believed that every real programmer should make a Tetris game at least once in their career.

## 🎮 Introduction

Creating a Tetris game has been on my mind since my early programming days. When I was in school, a young lecturer proudly demonstrated his own Tetris game, declaring it a rite of passage for every programmer. I took his words to heart and promised myself that, when the time was right, I would build my own version. 

In 2008, while working with Delphi, I finally made it happen! **TetriX** became my take on this timeless puzzle game, crafted from scratch in **Delphi 7**.
